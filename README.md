Heart Disease Prediction Model

-This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using a machine learning model trained on a dataset of clinical features. The model can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals for early intervention and personalized care.

The model is trained and evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. By analyzing patterns in patient data, the model can make predictions based on clinical risk factors.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains the following features:

- Age

- Sex

- Chest pain type

- Resting blood pressure

- Serum cholesterol
 
- Fasting blood sugar

- Resting ECG results

- Maximum heart rate

- Exercise-induced angina

- ST depression induced by exercise

- Slope of the ST segment

- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy

- Thalassemia diagnosis

- Target: Diagnosis of heart disease (binary outcome)

The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize feature ranges, and encode categorical variables.

Model used in this project :- Logistic Regression
